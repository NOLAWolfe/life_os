feat(refactor): "Financial Sweep" - SQLite Core & Enterprise Security

## 🏰 Major Architectural Overhaul
- **SQLite-First:** Migrated the Financial Engine and Professional Hub to fully rely on the local SQLite database.
- **Removed Legacy JSON/CSV:** Deleted `professional_data.json`, `daily_reads.json`, and `public/*.csv` to enforce database truth.
- **Cleaned .env:** Removed `.env.example` files to prevent PII leakage. `VITE_INTERNAL_KEYWORDS` verified unused and removed.

## 💼 Professional Hub (QA Co-Pilot)
- **Engine Upgrade:** Implemented `professional_engine` with `qaService` and `qaRepository`.
- **Agile Board:** Added Kanban-style Board View and rich `description` fields to User Stories.
- **Synthetic Data:** Added `scripts/seed_qa_data.js` to populate the hub with realistic demo tickets.

## 💰 Financial Engine
- **Debt Strategy Unlocked:** Implemented `syncDebtPlanner` to extract *actual* Interest Rates and Min Payments from Tiller's raw cells.
- **Sorting Hat:** Connected `TransactionMapper` to live DB transactions.
- **Drift Detection:** Verified accurate audit against live Tiller accounts.

## 🛡️ Security
- **Hardened .gitignore:** Explicitly ignored `LifeVault/`, `.gemini/`, and all local data files.
- **PII Scrub:** Ensured no real names or account numbers exist in tracked files.

## 🧪 Verification
- Frontend builds successfully (`vite build`).
- `verify_data.js` confirms 484 transactions and 11 debt items synced.
