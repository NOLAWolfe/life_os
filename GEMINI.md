# Life_OS Project Overview (Life.io)
Current Version: 2.2 (The Financial Command Center)
User: Neauxla (Senior QA Automation Analyst, Musician, Entrepreneur)

## **CURRENT STATUS (as of Dec 19, 2025)**
The project has achieved a major milestone: the "Financial OS" is now a fully functional, data-driven strategic command center. We have moved beyond simple visualization to **active auditing and strategy**.

1.  **The Vision: "Life.io"**
    Life.io is a unified, aesthetic web platform serving as a comprehensive "Operating System" for Neauxla's life. It bridges the gap between personal management (health, finance, creativity) and high-level professional productivity (QA automation, DevOps).
    Core Philosophy: "Stop using 5 different apps. Centralize Data. Automate Everything."

2.  **The Landing Page: A Central Dashboard**
    The landing page is now a data-driven hub.
    *   **Status:** Live (Phase 1+)
    *   **Current:** Featuring a live calendar widget, an account balances widget, and the new **Small Win Widget**.
    *   **Small Win Widget:** Dynamically identifies the next debt priority and provides actionable weekly payment tasks based on the user's "Active Plan".

3.  **Project Roadmap & Modules**

    **A. Professional Hub ("The QA Co-Pilot")**
    *   **Status:** In Progress (Mock AI)
    *   **Current:** A dedicated page in the UI fetches mock User Stories and Bugs from a mock `adoService`. 

    **B. Business & Finance (The Financial Assistant)**
    *   **Status:** Live (Strategic Command Center)
    *   **Strategy Tab (The War Room):**
        *   **Payment Flowchart:** Interactive map of Hubs -> Accounts -> Bills. Features **Drift Detection** (flagging mispaid bills) and live **Money Flow** stats.
        *   **Leak Detector:** Analyzes micro-spending ("Death by 1000 Cuts") and amortizes large ghost bills.
        *   **Master Bills List:** A dynamic, expandable ledger of all recurring liabilities with due dates and cost breakdowns.
    *   **Analytics Tab (Wealth Creation):**
        *   **Income Streams:** Classified into Active, Side Hustle, and Passive. Features 10X targets and transaction drill-downs.
        *   **Spending & Budget:** Real-time tracking against Tiller budget columns.
    *   **Data Tab (The Engine):**
        *   **Robust Pipeline:** Handles Tiller CSVs with duplicate headers/messy data using smart value hunting.
        *   **Bank Connect:** UI ready for future Plaid integration.

    **C. Creative & DJ World**
    *   **Status:** In Progress (Mock API)

    **D. Health & Personal (The "Legacy" Migration)**
    *   **Status:** Completed (Phase 1)
    *   **Current:** Interactive `WorkoutTracker` and `MealPlanner` integrated with a Node.js/Express backend.

4.  **The Future Vision: "The Useful Assistant Suite"**
    Beyond the current modules, Life.io is evolving into a collection of specialized, local-first AI assistants.
    *   **Core Principles:** Personal-First, Local-First/Privacy-Respecting, and Decision Simplification.
    *   **Planned Assistants:**
        *   **Life Admin Assistant:** Handles logistics (bills, insurance, warranties).
        *   **Knowledge Memory (RAG):** A personal knowledge base for notes, PDFs, and snippets.
        *   **Decision Journal:** Tracks decisions and context to improve judgment quality.
        *   **Goal Decomposition:** Converts high-level goals into realistic weekly plans.
        *   **Home/Asset Manager:** Maintenance schedules and repair histories.
