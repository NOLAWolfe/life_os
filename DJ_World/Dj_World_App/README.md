# DJ World

DJ "Life Assistant" to link to my DJ Downloads folder (Music_Context); Link to _Serato_/, housed in my Music/ Folder, have a Sync/Parse script via serato-js, ultimately to build a DJ Critic Agent which will organize setlist based on historical Serato sets & build setlist for upcoming events. Bonus points if it can eventually link to Apple Music and build a list of music to gather - in my own way, DJ Pools(BPM Supreme, ClubKillers, etc) and keep track of that list.
