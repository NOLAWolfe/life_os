# 🎓 Life.io Academy: The Golden Path

Welcome to the **Life.io Academy**. This guide is designed to take you from "Day 1" to "Senior Contributor" by building a real feature from scratch.

## 🏆 The Mission: "The Pet Tracker"
Instead of reading abstract docs, you will build a full-stack module called **"The Pet Tracker"**.
*   **Goal:** Track when the dog was fed and walked.
*   **Why:** It touches every layer of our stack (Prisma -> Service -> API -> UI -> State).
