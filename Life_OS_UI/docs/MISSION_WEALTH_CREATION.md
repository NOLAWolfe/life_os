# Mission: Wealth Creation (The 10X Pivot)

**Goal:** Shift the Financial Dashboard from "Defense" (Budgeting/Saving) to "Offense" (Earning/Expanding).
**Philosophy:** Based on Grant Cardone's "10X Rule" - Success is a duty, obligation, and responsibility.

## Feature 1: The "10X Targets" Widget
**Purpose:** Visualization of massive expansion goals.
*   **Concept:** User sets a "Moonshot" annual income or net worth goal (e.g., $1M/year).
*   **Visuals:** Progress bar scaling against the 10X number, not just the monthly budget.
*   **Psychology:** "You cannot hit a target you do not see."

## Feature 2: "The Mentor" / Strategy Feed
**Purpose:** Daily guidance and motivation.
*   **Concept:** A dynamic feed of actionable "Rules of Wealth" and quotes.
*   **Logic:** Suggest specific financial actions based on real data (e.g., "Savings stagnant? Increase income streams.").
*   **Content:** Hard-hitting truths about money, debt, and scaling.

## Feature 3: Income Streams Tracker
**Purpose:** Gamify the creation of new revenue sources.
*   **Concept:** Track *sources* of income separately (Salary, Side Hustle, Investments, Sales).
*   **Metrics:** Calculate "Passive vs. Active" income ratio.
*   **Goal:** Diversification and scaling revenue, not just cutting costs.
