# Useful Assistants – Project Context & Vision

## Purpose

This project aims to create a **collection of actually useful AI assistants** designed for:
- Real-world utility
- Personal-first use
- Privacy and local-first execution
- Long-term scalability into professional and enterprise contexts

These assistants are **tools**, not generic chatbots.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Personal-First, Scalable-by-Design
- Initial user: **single trusted user**
- Architecture supports future multi-user or enterprise deployment
- No design decisions that require rewrites later

### 2. Local-First & Privacy-Respecting
- Data stays under user control
- No forced third-party APIs
- No silent telemetry
- Self-hosting is a feature, not a limitation

### 3. Decision Simplification > Content Generation
- Assistants exist to reduce cognitive load
- Focus on clarity, tradeoffs, and next actions
- Avoid novelty or “AI for AI’s sake”
